                <h4>What are the effects and impacts of climate change?</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Impacts of a 1.1-degree increase are here today in the increased frequency and magnitude of extreme weather events from heatwaves, droughts, flooding, winter storms, hurricanes and wildfires. (IPCC)</li>
                    <li>The global average temperature in 2019 was 1.1 degrees Celsius above the pre-industrial period, according to WMO.</li>
                    <li>2019 concluded a decade of exceptional global heat, retreating ice and record sea levels driven by greenhouse gases produced by human activities. (WMO)</li>
                    <li>30 per cent of the world's population is exposed to deadly heat waves more than 20 days a year. (Cooling and Climate Change fact sheet, UNEP)</li>
                    <li>Average temperatures for the five-year (2015-2019) and ten-year (2010-2019) periods are the highest on record. (WMO)</li>
                    <li>2019 was the second hottest year on record. (WMO)</li>
                    <li>In 2019, total greenhouse gas emissions, including land-use change, reached a new high of 59.1 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (GtCO2e). (EGR, 2020)</li>
                    <li>Based on today's insufficient global commitments to reduce climate polluting emissions, a rebound in greenhouse gases from a return to high-carbon societies after the pandemic may push 2030 emissions even higher â€“ up to 60 GtCO2e. (EGR, 2020)</li>
                </ul>
